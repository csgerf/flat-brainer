# GANs
## Generative Adversarial Networks
### Considerations

1. **Condtional GAN**

instead of using a GAN to generate more images and then segmenting those, you could train a conditional GAN (cGAN) to generate segmented images directly.

2. Active Learning

you start with a small amount of labeled data and train your model on it. You then use your model to make predictions on your unlabeled data, and label the data that your model is most unsure about. This can be an effective way to make the most of a small amount of labeled data.
